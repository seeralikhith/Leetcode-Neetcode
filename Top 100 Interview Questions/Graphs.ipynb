    "   - \"B may or may not be a celebrity\"\n",
    "   - \"A is not the celebrity\" (because a celebrity doesn't know anyone)\n",

    "1. **Base Case:**\n",
    "   - If A = 0 and B = 1:\n",

    "     - `knows(1,0) = True`: Node 1 knows Node 0 ⇒ Node 1 is not a celebrity ⇒ Node 0 may be the potential candidate.\n",
    "     - `knows(1,0) = False`: Node 1 doesn't know Node 0 ⇒ Node 0 is not a celebrity ⇒ Node 1 may be the potential candidate.\n",

    "2. **Iterative/Recursive Case:**\n",
    "   Using the base case, repeat this process of comparison until the (n-1) nodes:\n",

    "        - (Continue with the current candidate)\n",

    "3. **Terminating Case:**\n",
    "   From both cases, check:\n",
    "   1. If `knows(candidate, k) == True` or `knows(k, candidate) == False`:\n",
    "      - Node candidate knows Node k or Node k doesn't know Node candidate ⇒ Node 'k' is not the celebrity.\n",
